# Clarity
Clarity is a language for the bitcoin blockchain development.
It is inspired by the syntax of lisp ( a language of the past ) and that is it's beauty.

## Syntax
The language opted a really unique syntax that for some people make it hard to learn and some people admire it.
This self explanatory sytnax gives following powers to the clarity that we did not have before, making it 
one of the top notch languages in blockchain development.

## Features of Clarity

### Predictable
Clarity uses to-the-point and clear syntax that is easy for developers to predict what will happen if this code is executed?
Makin it predictable ( top quality for blockchain development languages ).

### Secure
Clarity provides you with the facility to impose conditions on contract functions ( just like the modifiers in solidity).
These conditions are the backbones of eliminating fradulent transactions .

#### For example
On Transfer function of an NFT , we can have a condition that the person who is trying to transfer the NFT must have the privileges to do so.
He Must be the owner of that NFT.

### Elimination of compiler
Clarity eliminates the need of the compiler to publish on blockchain.
The contracts written in solidity are directly broadcasted to the stacks blockchain.
So you better have to write test and analyze the smart contracts before deploying on the blockchain.

For that purpose , we will [Clarity Tools]() later in this course.


### Post-conditions
One of the most exciting features for me that clarity provide is post conditions.
Post conditions means what msut happen after the execution of piece of some particular code.
It reduces bugs and it's a good way to do testing inside smart contracts  : )

### Bitcoin state
Bitcoin always been a ledger but now stacks is leveraging the bitcoin state to its fullest.
with clarity , it is possible to have the super powers of reading the bitcoin blockchain and build on top of it.
We are working hard for granting you Further super powers .


With these benefits, i think i have convinced you to start learning clarity with me .

Yes or Yes ?

Yes ? Wow !

So Let's move to next lesson about [Getting Started with Clarity](./Getting-Started-With-Clarity.md)
