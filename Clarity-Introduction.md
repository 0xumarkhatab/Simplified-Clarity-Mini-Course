# Clarity

Clarity is a language for the bitcoin blockchain development.

It is inspired by the syntax of lisp ( a language of the past ) and that is its beauty.



## Syntax

The language opted for a really unique syntax that for some people make it hard to learn and some people admire it.

This self-explanatory syntax gives the following powers to Clarity that we did not have before, making it 

one of the top-notch languages in blockchain development.



## Features of Clarity



### Predictable

arity to-the-point and clear syntax that is easy for developers to predict what will happen if this code is executed?

Makin it predictable ( top quality for blockchain development languages ).



### Secure

Clarity provides you with the facility to impose conditions on contract functions.

These conditions are the backbone of eliminating fraudulent transactions.



#### For example

On the Transfer function of an NFT, we can have a condition that the person who is trying to transfer the NFT must have the privileges to do so.

He Must be the owner of that NFT.



### Elimination of compiler

Clarity eliminates the need for the compiler to publish on the blockchain.

The contracts written in solidity are directly broadcasted to the stacks blockchain.

So you better have to write tests and analyze the smart contracts before deploying on the blockchain.



For that purpose, we will use [Clarity Tools](https://clarity.tools/) later in this course.





### Post-conditions

One of the most exciting features for me that clarity provide is post conditions.

Postconditions mean what must happen after the execution of a piece of some particular code.

It reduces bugs and it's a good way to do testing inside smart contracts  : )



### Bitcoin state

Bitcoin has always been a ledger but now Stacks is leveraging the bitcoin state to its fullest.

Clarity smart contracts have somehow this special visibility into the state of the Bitcoin blockchain.

So, the contract functions written in a Clarity file can be triggered when specific Bitcoin transactions are confirmed.

We are working hard for granting you Further superpowers.



## Why you Must choose Clarity

Below, we got the [Comparison of Solidity, Move, and Clarity ](https://101blockchains.com/solidity-vs-move-vs-clarity/) for deciding which one is the best.

Although solidity is flexible enough to start blockchain development, it really suffers from re-entrancy bugs and code transparency.



In clarity, yes it is a little difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, you will love it. 



There are no re-entrancy attacks here. Also, the compiler elimination and multiple data types are the plus points to tell you why you should migrate to clarity now!





With these benefits, I think I have convinced you to start learning clarity with me.



Yes or Yes?



Yes? Wow!



So Let's move to the next lesson about [Getting Started with Clarity](./Getting-Started-With-Clarity.md)
