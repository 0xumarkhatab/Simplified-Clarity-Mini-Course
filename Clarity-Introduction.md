# Clarity
Clarity is a language for the bitcoin blockchain development.
It is inspired by the syntax of lisp ( a language of the past ) and that is it's beauty.

## Syntax
The language opted a really unique syntax that for some people make it hard to learn and some people admire it.
This self explanatory sytnax gives following powers to the clarity that we did not have before, making it 
one of the top notch languages in blockchain development.

## Features of Clarity

### Predictable
Clarity uses to-the-point and clear syntax that is easy for developers to predict what will happen if this code is executed?
Makin it predictable ( top quality for blockchain development languages ).

### Secure
Clarity provides you with the facility to impose conditions on contract functions ( just like the modifiers in solidity).
These conditions are the backbones of eliminating fradulent transactions .

#### For example
On Transfer function of an NFT , we can have a condition that the person who is trying to transfer the NFT must have the privileges to do so.
He Must be the owner of that NFT.

### Elimination of compiler
Clarity eliminates the need of the compiler to publish on blockchain.
The contracts written in solidity are directly broadcasted to the stacks blockchain.
So you better have to write test and analyze the smart contracts before deploying on the blockchain.

For that purpose , we will use [Clarity Tools](https://clarity.tools/) later in this course.


### Post-conditions
One of the most exciting features for me that clarity provide is post conditions.
Post conditions means what msut happen after the execution of piece of some particular code.
It reduces bugs and it's a good way to do testing inside smart contracts  : )

### Bitcoin state
Bitcoin always been a ledger but now stacks is leveraging the bitcoin state to its fullest.
Clarity smart contracts have somehow this special visibility into the state of the Bitcoin blockchain.<br/>
Sp ,the contract functions written in a Clarity file can be triggered when specific Bitcoin transactions are confirmed.
We are working hard for granting you Further super powers.

## Why you Must choose Clarity
Below here, we got the [Comparison of Solidity,Move and Clarity ](https://101blockchains.com/solidity-vs-move-vs-clarity/)and deciding which is the best.

![Solidity-Vs-Move-Vs-Clarity-Key-Differences_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71306738/207467487-c0a21515-5344-460d-835e-5f9da718ba7a.jpg)


Although , solidity is flexible enough to start blockchain development , but it really suffers in re-entrancy bugs and code transparency .

In clarity , yes it is a little difficult at first but once you get the hang of it , you will love it . 

There is no re-entrancy attacks here also the compiler elimination and multiples data types are the plus points to tell you 

why you should migrate to clarity now !


With these benefits, i think i have convinced you to start learning clarity with me .

Yes or Yes ?

Yes ? Wow !

So Let's move to next lesson about [Getting Started with Clarity](./Getting-Started-With-Clarity.md)
