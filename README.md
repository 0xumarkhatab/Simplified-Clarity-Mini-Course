## Purpose 



This is a guide on how to get started with Bitcoin Blockchain Development powered by [Stacks Ecosystem](https://www.stacks.co/) using `Clarity`.



Clarity is a powerful programming language.

It provides features like predictability, security, and post-conditions that made me fall in love with it.

You will fall in love with it too when we go in depth later in this course.



## Why This Course?

Clarity has content available but is very sparse and difficult to understand for beginners.

So, we thought that it would be a good idea to have a place where people can get started with clarity

in simple language and build at least one project while going along and moving further.



And that is the agenda of this course.



## Final Project 

You will have your own `TODO App` written using Clarity at the end of this course where you can add, remove and mark items as complete. So, Let's go!
