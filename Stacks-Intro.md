We will not go into much details how stacks work uner the hood for now but you need to know that stacks use proof of history mechanism.

# How It works ?
It anchors the history of the bitcoin blockchain so anything present on the bitcoin chain is also present on stacks chain
and transactions made on stacks chain are also verifiable on bitcoin chain.
