# Getting-Started-With-Clarity

    "Talk is cheap , show me the code"
    
    
Finally we are here to start learning the actual code after so much theory 

## What you will learn in Clarity ?

You will mainly be learning about the things that are required for making the project we are trying to build <br/>
but still we will have a look at some important stuff that is not directly relavant to our final project <br/>
but will help you in the long run as a `Clarity developer`

Mainly we will learn about

        
        Variables ( All types available in clarity )
        Function ( Built in and User-defined )
        Mappings 


### Learning approach
We will be learning by building and at the end you will be submitting your code.
