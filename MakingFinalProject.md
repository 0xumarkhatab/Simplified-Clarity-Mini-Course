# Final Project
![superman_child](https://books.forbes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bigstock-Strong-superhero-girl-with-sup-240951781.jpg)

Finally it is the time to show your super powers and build the final project as we go !

# Project scope 
Smart contracts are resource-constraint. Developers that just enter the blockchain space usually bring with them certain assumptions that maybe are invalid when writing smart contracts. It is important to remember that a blockchain is distributed data storage. Every state change is paid for in terms of the miner fee.
So you should consider storing data off-chain and may use the  reference of that data to use in smart contract if smart contract does not directly use it .

For building large applications , you should have a look at t[Best practices about data storage in clarity](https://book.clarity-lang.org/ch13-02-what-to-store-on-chain.html)

## Clarity Tools
Clarity tools is a playground for clarity development where you can write your code and execute on the go to see your results.
It also has a lot of code snippers to learn from . Really Helpful. <br/>
We will use clarity tools for our project. <br/>

Check clarity tools [Here](https://clarity.tools/)


## Primary variables we will use
index       - will be used as key in map to store and access different todo items - it's value will be increased by 1 each time a new item is added <br/>
items       - the place where all todo items will be stored
temp-tuple  - to hold  intermediate data when we complete an item ( more on this later )

### Vaiables declaration
```clarity
(define-data-var index (int) 0)
(define-map items (int) {label : (string-utf8) ,is-completed:(Boolean)})
(define-data-var temp-tuple {label : string-utf8 ,is-completed:Boolean}) {label:"",is-completed:false}

```
we have defined two variables <br/>
`index`has initial value 0 having type `signed integer`<br/>
`temp-tuple` is an empty tuple having a ```clarity utf8 string ``` as `label` and a ```clarity Boolean ``` named `is-completed`<br/>
which will tell us if the particular item is completed or not.

`items` is a mapping with key type as `uint` and value type is `string` <br/>


## add-item Function
### Purpose
it is a function that receives a todo item and adds to the items list.

### Technicality

    - It receives a string type item as paramter.
    - Stores on current value of index in items list using 'map-set' function
    - increments the value of index variable to store next item at new location
    - Sends back an ok message that item is added
    - Exits


## remove-item Function
### Purpose
it is a function that deletes the an item from items at the specific index

### Technicality

    - It receives index of the file to be deleted 
    - deletes the file using "map-delete" method of map.
    - Sends back an ok message that item is Removed
    - Exits

## complete-item Function
### Purpose
it is a function that marks the todo item as complete by appending a string "-Completed " on it's last.
This is just an introductory course so we are not moving to the depth  of removing items or  storing in seprate data structures.

Let's go for simplicity here too : )

### Technicality

    - It has a paramter of the position of  item ( index of item the item is stored at)
    - Fetches the item the given index
    - Concatenate the string "- Completed" with it.
    - Stores in temporary variable we made at the top "te,pString"
    - Stores in Items list at the same index as paramter specified but this is an updated value
    - Sends back an ok message that item is Completed
    - Exits


## print-item Function
### Purpose
A utility function to print an item in the map at specific index

### code

```clarity


(define-public (add-item (item (string-utf8)))
  
  (map-insert items (var-get index) {label:item,is-completed:false})
  (var-set index (+ (var-get index) 1))
  "item has been added in todo list ")
(define-public (remove-item (itemIndex (int)))
  (map-delete items itemIndex)
  (ok "You Item has been removed from todo list"))

(define-public (complete-item(item-position (int)))
  (var-set temp-tuple {label:(get label (try! (map-get? items item-position ) ) ),is-completed:true})
  (map-delete items item-position)
  (map-insert items item-position  (var-get temp-tuple))  

  ok "You Item is marked completed")

(define-public (print-item (item-index (int)))
 (get label (try! (map-get? items item-index))))
   
   
```

## Functoin invocation
```clarity
(add-item "Gym at 5 AM")
```

we call the function `add-item` with a todo item to add which is `Gym at 5 AM`
<br/>
and then we call the same function with different todo items to store !
```clarity

(add-item "Gym at 5 AM")

(add-item "Breakfast at 7 AM") 
(add-item "Office at 8 AM")
```

We call the function `remove-item` to remove the last element  in the list which in our  case is "Office at breakfast"


```clarity
(remove-item 0)

```

Similarly the `complete-item` function is called here as 

```clarity

(complete-item 1)

```


## Printing the Todo list
We print the todo list by printing number of todo items first and then using the `print-item` function.


```clarity

(print "total items in the todo-list are ")(print ( var-get index))

(print "Printing Todo List ")


(print-item 0)

(print-item 1)

(print-item 2)



```

### But what is try ?
if we just write 
```clarity
(print (map-get? items 0))

```
clarity will still give the answer but it will be wrapped in a `some` keyword like ... `some "Gym at 5 AM" ` <br/>
but we want the value `Gym at 5 AM` not the `some` thing. That's where `try! built in function` comes handy.

It takes an input , unwraps the variable and gives the value we want in this case `Gym at 5 AM`.

So this was all regrading building our project !

Pay close attention to the left side outputs clarity tools is giving you .

It is the output of each line after execution.
